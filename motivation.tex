  \begin{itemize}
      \item[$\bullet$] Automating deployments to meet power demands can be difficult for complicated
                       transition scenarios. 
      \item[$\bullet$] The deployment of reactors to create a balanced closed fuel cycle can be a 
                       complicated process. Ensuring that there is enough fast reactor fuel for
                       their operation requires the appropriate support fleet of light water reactors.
      \item[$\bullet$] Additionally, requiring users figure out the correct number of support
                       structures for the reactors fleets is a tedious job for humans.
